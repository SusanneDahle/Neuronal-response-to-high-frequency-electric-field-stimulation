# Neuronal-response-to-high-frequency-electric-field-stimulation

Code used in "Neuronal response to high-frequency electric field stimulation" master's thesis.

## Code overview:

**run_simulations.py** contains simulation code used on all neocortical neuron models stimulated with external electric field.

**run_simulations_simplified_neuron_models.py** contains simulation code used for the idealized neuron models stimulated with external electric field. 

Plots_neocortical_neuron_models loads data from simulation with all neocortical neuron models, and contains plot functions for Figures 5, 14-19 and C.4-14.

**Plots_idealized_neuron_models.ipynb** loads data from simulation with idealized neuron models, and contains plot functions for Figures 8, 12, C.2 and C.3. 

**White_noise.ipynb** contains white noise current stimulation and extracellular electric field stimulation to three selected neurons. In addition to plot-function for Figures 20 and 21.

**lambda_ac.ipynb** contains code used to calculate frequency dependent length constants, and plot-function for Figure 13.

**Hay_neuron.ipynb** contains simulation code for active and passive hay neuron, and plot functions for Figures 10, 11, and C.1.
