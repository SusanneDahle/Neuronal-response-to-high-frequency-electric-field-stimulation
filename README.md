- Simulation code used on all neocortical neuron models stimulated with external electric field.

**run_simulations_simplified_neuron_models.py**
- Simulation code used for the idealized neuron models stimulated with external electric field. 

**Plots_neocortical_neuron_models.ipynb**
- Loads data from simulation with all neocortical neuron models
- Plot functions for Figures 5, 9, 14-19 and C.4-14
- Calculations for Tables 2 and C.1

**Plots_idealized_neuron_models.ipynb** 
- Loads data from simulation with idealized neuron models
- Plot functions for Figures 8, 12, C.2 and C.3. 

**White_noise.ipynb**
- White noise current stimulation and extracellular electric field stimulation to three selected neurons.
- Plot-function for Figures 20 and 21.

**Lambda_ac.ipynb**
- Code used to calculate frequency dependent length constants
- Plot-function for Figure 13.

**Hay_neuron.ipynb**
- Simulation code for the active and the passive Hay neuron
- Plot functions for Figures 10, 11, and C.1.
