# Neuronal-response-to-high-frequency-electric-field-stimulation

Simulation code to Neuronal response to high-frequency electric field stimulation, master thesis.

## Code overview:

lambda_ac.ipnby contains code used to calculate frequency dependent length constants, and plot-function for Figure 12

run_simulations.py contains simulation code used on all neocortical neuron models.

run_simulations_simplified_neuron_models.py contains simulation code used for the idealized neuron models.
