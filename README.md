# Neuronal-response-to-high-frequency-electric-field-stimulation

Code used in "Neuronal response to high-frequency electric field stimulation" master's thesis.

## Code overview:

**run_simulations.py** contains simulation code used on all neocortical neuron models stimulated with external electric field.

**run_simulations_simplified_neuron_models.py** contains simulation code used for the idealized neuron models stimulated with external electric field. 

**White_noise.ipynb** contains white noise current stimulation and extracellular electric field stimulation to three selected neurons. In addition to plot-function for Figures 20 and 21.

**lambda_ac.ipynb** contains code used to calculate frequency dependent length constants, and plot-function for Figure 12.
